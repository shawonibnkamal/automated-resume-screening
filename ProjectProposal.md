### Goal

The goal of this project is to built an automated resume screening application. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a practical industry use of Natural Language Processing that helps businesses save resources on recruitment.

### Description

The application will be built on python. It will consist of two main parts:

1. **Extraction of information from resume**\
This will include parsing of resume files (.pdf, .docx, etc.) to structered usable information that can be processed. The output type will be a python dictionary.

2. **Evaluation**\
Here, we will evaluate the usable informations to find a score for a given job description. This score will help rank resumes. The process will be done using a combination of few natural language processing and  machine learning algorithms. The evaluation will be based on these primary factors:

   - Work Experience
   - Education
   - Skills
   - Personality

3. **Visualization**\
After evaluation, the results will be visualized using Python Matplotlib.
